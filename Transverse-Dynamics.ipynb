    "Today’s final exercise will be to look at how we can correct for a local orbit distortion. In this FODO lattice, F = 20 meters, L  = 25 and at specific locations in the structure (initially position ‘10’), there is an additional element –a steering error –which gives the particle an angular deflection of amount $\\theta$ each time the particle passes by. By looking at the plot of particle displacement, we see that when the particle starts with x = 0 and x’ = 0, it begins a betatron oscillation when it passes by the steering error (see the SOLID trace in the plot). \n",
    "This steering error can be caused by an improperly set steering magnet or by a mis-aligned quadrupole magnet. There are some scenarios in which the steering \"error\" may be introduced intentionally, for example to place the beam on a diagnostic that is out of the way of the normal beam path.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a particular orbit which, if the particle trajectory starts out just right, the orbit will be deflected by the steering error but when it returns to the beginning of the accelerator will end up with the same position and slope it started out with. Thus, this particular particle will follow the same path over and over again. \n",
    "- Change $N_{turn}$ from 1 to 2, 5, 10, 100. \n",
    "- Notice how the particle appears to oscillate about the new closed orbit generated by the steering magnet. \n",
    "\n",
    "Even though the magnet only steers the particle at one location in the accelerator, it can affect the displacement everywhere. If F and L are in meters, x in millimeters, and x’ in mrad, then $\\theta$ is in mrad (0.05 initially)."
