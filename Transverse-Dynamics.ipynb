    "Today’s final exercise will be to look at how we can correct for a local orbit distortion. We will change our FODO lattice parameters somewhat, to F = 20 meters, L  = 25 meters. At a specific location in the lattice (s=10), there is an additional element: a steering error which gives the particle an angular deflection of amount $\\theta$ each time the particle passes by. By looking at the plot of particle displacement, we see that althought the particle starts on the ideal orbit (x = 0 and x’ = 0), it begins a betatron oscillation when it passes by the steering error (examine the SOLID trace in the plot). \n",
    "This steering error can be caused by an improperly set steering magnet or by a mis-aligned quadrupole magnet. There are some scenarios in which the steering \"error\" may be introduced intentionally, for example to place the beam on a diagnostic that is out of the way of the normal beam path.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a particular trajectory which, at the end of 1 turn, will have the same position and slope/angle as at the start of the turn. This particular trajectory is known as the *closed orbit*, meaning a particle on this trajectory will follow the same path over and over again on every sequential turn. All other orbits will oscillate around the closed orbit. In the absence of steering errors, the ideal closed orbit goes through the center of all quadrupoles (x = 0 and x’ = 0).\n",
    "- Change $N_{turn}$ from 1 to 2, 5, 10, 100. \n",
    "- Notice how the particle appears to oscillate about the new closed orbit generated by the steering magnet. \n",
    "\n",
    "Even though the magnet only steers the particle at one location in the accelerator, it can affect the displacement everywhere. If F and L are in meters, x in millimeters, and x’ in mrad, then $\\theta$ is in mrad (0.05 initially)."
