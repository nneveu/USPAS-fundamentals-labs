    "For transverse motion of a particle (beam) to be stable, the trace of the 2X2 transport matrix for each degree of freedom (horizontal and vertical) must be less than or equal to 2 in absolute value: |TrM| ≤2. For a simple FODO structure made up of thin-lens focusing elements (kicks of focal length ±F) separated by a drifts of distance L, the stability condition is equivalent to F ≥L/2. \n",

The indices on the position $x_{i,j}$ are for the j-th passage through the i-th element of the structure. The number of turns begins with `N_turn= 1` and with $x_{0,0}= 5$ mm. \n",

In a thin-lens FODO lattice, instability appears when when |TrM| > 2, or equivalently, when F < L/2. Here TrM is the trace of the transport matrix M.

    "## 3. Closed Orbit Error & Correction\n",
    "\n",
    "Today’s final exercise will be to look at how we can correct for a local orbit distortion. For this exercise, we will change our FODO lattice parameters to F = 20 meters and L  = 25 meters. At a specific location in the lattice ($s=10$ meters), there is an additional element: a dipole steering error which gives the particle an angular deflection kick $\\theta$ each time the particle passes. By looking at the plot of particle displacement, we see that although the particle starts on the ideal orbit (x = 0 and x’ = 0), it begins a betatron oscillation after it passes the steering error kick (note the SOLID trace in the plot). This steering error can be caused by an improperly set steering magnet or by a mechanically mis-aligned quadrupole magnet (displaced quadrupole gives a dipole + quadrupole). There are also some scenarios in which a steering \"error\" is introduced intentionally. For example,  the beam may be steered off-axis to place the beam on a diagnostic that is out of the way of the normal beam path or to help kick the beam out of the ring.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even in the presence of steering kicks, there is a particular trajectory which, at the end of 1 turn, will have the same position and slope/angle as at the start of the turn. This particular trajectory is known as the *closed orbit*, meaning a particle on this trajectory will follow the same path over and over again on every sequential turn. All other orbits will oscillate about the closed orbit. In the absence of steering errors, the ideal closed orbit goes through the center of all quadrupoles ($x = 0$ and $x’ = 0$).\n",
    "- Change $N_{turn}$ from 1 to 2, 5, 10, 100. \n",
    "- Notice how the particle appears to oscillate about the new closed orbit generated by the steering magnet. \n",
    "\n",
    "Even though the magnet only steers the particle at one specific location in the accelerator lattice, it can affect the displacement everywhere. \n"
