To measure the synchroton tune in a real accelerator, we don't normally have access to the $Delta E$ coordinate of beam, and have to settle for a measurement of the phase alone. By looking at the frequency of the oscillation in phase we can deduce the synchrotron tune. The tool we use to extract frequency from phase data is called a `Fast Fourier Transform(FFT)`. In this section we will apply an FFT simulated data from the Fermilab Main Injector. \n",
