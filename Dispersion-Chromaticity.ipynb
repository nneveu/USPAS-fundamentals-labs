    "### A) Dispersion in FODO lattice\n",
    "\n",
    "In other labs, we simulate beamlines without dipoles. Dipoles create dispersion ($\\eta$ or D, depending who you talk to), which describes the evolution of transverse size for particles/beams that are off-momentum. Off-momentum particles experience a different force in the dipole than the design orbit, as they have different magnetic rigidity $B\\rho=\\frac{p}{q}$. Dispersion is a function of s and can have a periodic (matched) solution, similar to the $\\beta$ and $\\alpha$ functions.\n",

    "First, scroll to the sigma_output plot to observe the effect of the dipole on the beam moments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the sigma_output plot is generated by tracking a particle distribution through the cell. This distribution does not include a momentum spread, so dispersion should not affect the results of this plot. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, you will observe that Sx looks slightly different from the case without a dipole. There is a small de-focusing kick at the entrance of the dipole, and a small focusing kick at the exit of the dipole. These two kicks cancel, and the periodic solution in the horizontal plane is almost identical to the FODO cell without a dipole. \n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, the average value of Sy has decreased significantly, and there is a focusing kick at the entrance and exit. The dipole has a net focusing effect in the vertical plane. \n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for these differences is an effect called *edge focusing*, which is caused by fringe fields that extend past the edge of the dipole. An exploration of edge focusing is beyond the scope of this lab, but it is good to be aware that this is another way in which dipoles affect the lattice and beam parameters. Edge focusing is an effect which does not depend on beam energy spread. In contrast, the strength of the effects caused by dispersion and chromaticity do depend on energy spread in the particle distribution - which is mainly determined by the RF system used for acceleration.\n",
