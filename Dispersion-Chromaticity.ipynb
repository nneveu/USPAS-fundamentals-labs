    "- Press shift+enter to execute a cell, or use the play button at the top of the window\n",
    "- Make sure you execute cells in order, or re-execute cells if you change something at the top of the notebook.\n",
    "- You can also execute the whole notebook by using 'Run all cells' under the 'Run' tab.\n",

    "In other labs, we simulate beamlines without dipoles. Dipoles create dispersion ($\\eta$ or D, depending who you talk to), which describes the evolution of transverse size for particles/beams that are off-momentum. Off-momentum particles experience a different force in the dipole than the design orbit, as they have different magnetic rigidity $B\\rho=\\frac{p}{q}$. Dispersion is a function of s and can have a periodic (matched) solution, similar to the $\\beta$ and $\\alpha$ functions.\n",
